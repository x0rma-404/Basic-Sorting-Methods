## ⚡ Example Output

```python
arr = [64,32,76,98,54,54,33,88,66,12,37]

print(bubble(arr))
# Output: [12, 32, 33, 37, 54, 54, 64, 66, 76, 88, 98]

print(selection(arr))
# Output: [12, 32, 33, 37, 54, 54, 64, 66, 76, 88, 98]

print(quick(arr))
# Output: [12, 32, 33, 37, 54, 54, 64, 66, 76, 88, 98]
```
